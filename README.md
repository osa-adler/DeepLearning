Report on the Neural Network Model
The purpose of this analysis was to help nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Alphabet Soup's business team provided me with a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within that dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
